I am a microbial and computational biologist with extensive training in ecology and statistics.
I am broadly interested in building bioinformatics tools to aid microbiological research. 
In my graduate research, I am using phylogenetic methods to develop software 
for predicting functional traits of prokaryotic taxa uncovered in microbiome
surveys. As a first-generation college student, I am deeply passionate about science 
education and empowering students of all backgrounds to view themselves as capable learners of
biology, statistics, and programming.

I am currently a Biology PhD candidate at the University of Oregon in
the [Louca lab](http://www.loucalab.com/). For my dissertation, I am working with a large
team of undergraduates to build a phenotypic database of metabolic traits of prokaryotes,
and using these data as a central resource in a software that predicts the functional traits
of OTUs in 16S-based microbiome studies.

In 2020, I earned my B.S. with Honors in Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources with a minor in
Statistics at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. For my honors thesis, I worked with 
[Dr. Myla Aronson](https://sites.rutgers.edu/myla-aronson/) to study the phenotypic traits of the
world's most common urban plant species. In 2019, I was an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates
scholar in [Dr. Britt Koskella](https://naturesmicrocosm.com/)'s lab at UC Berkeley. During this fellowship, I worked with Dr. Kyle Meyer
to study how plant neighborhoods influence phyllosphere microbiome assembly.

Outside of academics, I enjoy running, weightlifting, hiking, and backpacking. I'm also an avid music listener, self-taught 
music producer, and DJ. I host a [music show](https://spinitron.com/KWVA/pl/21645660/Microcosm) on the University of Oregon campus radio, KWVA Eugene 88.1FM.
